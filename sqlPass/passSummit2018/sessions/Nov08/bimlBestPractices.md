## Level Up Your Biml: Best Practices and Coding Techniques

### Speaker:

### Speaker: Cathrine Wilhelmsen

## Abstract
> *Is your Biml solution starting to remind you of a bowl of tangled spaghetti code? Good! That means you are solving real problems while saving a lot of time. The next step is to make sure that your solution does not grow too complex and confusing - you do not want to waste all that saved time on future maintenance!*
>
> *Attend this session for an overview of Biml best practices and coding techniques. Learn how to improve and simplify your solution by using some common and some lesser-known Biml features. If standard Biml is not enough, you can implement custom logic by creating your own C# classes and methods. Finally, see how to bring everything together in an example project for creating and loading a data mart with facts and dimensions.*
>
> *Start improving your code today and level up your Biml in no time!*

? Call BIML Script?

\- Can create classes as C#

? Do the Visual Studio automated refactoring tools recognize BIML code?
* No. Manual refactoring only

\- Can work with LINQ and Lambda expressions

\- BIML is used to create SSIS packages and SQL scripts

\- Projects with BIML should be used for one thing only which will help keep your work clean and clear

I Fact and Table dimenstions and SSIS

? SCD?

? What kind of unit testing can be done on BIML files

\- Create: Dimensions then Facts // Delete: Facts the Dimensions
