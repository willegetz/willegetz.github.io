## Test Driven Development in SQL Server â€“ How to Deploy Code Safer

### Speaker: Hamish Watson

### Abstract
> *Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.*
>
> *In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.*

\- TDD is a crystal ball which grants insight into what functionality to give the client

\- calling for increased agility in the data world

\- TDD is hard on databases because refactoring doesn't happen
- Furthermore, trying to apply software development refactoring principles to SProcs and scripts will result in poor performance

T [TSQLT](https://tsqlt.org), [Redgate SQL Test](https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-test/), [Visual Studio SSDT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-2017)
- As of this post the most recently available SSDT is for VS2017

? Source control your data?

? Can you unit test user/application role security?

? Shift-Left principle?

\- Continuous monitoring for permformance analysis

\- Don't use SELECT * because of the performance hit

\- TSQLT can be run in containers
- Alter Assembly tsqltclr with "permissions_set=external_access"
