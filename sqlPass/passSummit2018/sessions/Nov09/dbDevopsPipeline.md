## Building a Database DevOps Pipeline in the Cloud in < 59 minutes

## Speaker: Hamish Watson

## Abstract
> *DevOps processes encompass both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.*
> *Continuous integration is based around automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery allows both application developers, database developers and DBAs alike to deploy better quality code/software.  
In this DEMO heavy session, we will start off with source code only.*
> *Over the course of 59 minutes we will build a deployment pipeline that starts off with pushing our database and application code to source control. We will utilize Visual Studio Team Services to automate our build and tests and perform Continuous Integration operations.*
> *The output of these operations will be a standardized package of our built solution.*
> *Utilizing PowerShell in the form of Infrastructure as Code, we will spin up multiple Azure based environments that will be deployed to using automated Continuous Delivery processes.
The finished result will be an automated and reliable deployment pipeline that was built under 59 minutes.*
