## The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code

### Speaker: Amy Herold

### Abstract
> *There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance.*
>
> *How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.*

- ? Is there something similar for Aurora?

? NHibernate produces SQL Code?

T* SQL Sentry Plan Explorer

I Use of Approvals Entity Framework/NHibernate can help devs and DBAs. This testing tool will capture the generated TSQL output by these ORMs
- \* Create a sample application demonstrating the use of Approvals with EF and NHibernate 

! Demonstrate what the result of Approvals EF/NHibernate looks like
