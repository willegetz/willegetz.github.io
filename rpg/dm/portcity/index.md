# Port City
Ominous, foggy, smarmy

### Attributes and Ideas
- City started as a port town, but as it grew it absorbed the surrounding towns until it became a large cit., Many of the older towns are now called burgs
- Older towns along the coast slowly decayed into dilapidated fishing slums
- Main docks recieve shipping and fishing boats
- There are two light houses, one on each outcropping of rocks at either side of the bay
- Buildings are generally tall two or three storey structures, some of which jut out over the street and choke out the sun and starlight
- Main town by the docks is the most crowded with lots of sloping streets leading to and from the warf
  - Warehouses, shps, cramped houses, inns, pawn shops, and other such things can be found in this area
- Surrouning burgs range from wealthy to slums
- Temples to the main gods are few, many of which are merely shrines tucked in along the streets. These shrines are tended to by one or a few clerics
  - Full temples to the main gods exist in some of the wealthier burgs. These temples are the stone built, cathedral like structures which come to mind in fantasy rpgs. These temples have more clerics and resources to help those in their burg
  - Some of the slums have what passes for a full temple, though it may merely be a large ramshackle house or a collection of tarps and nets over some driftwood or found blocks. There would not typically be more than a handful of clerics at these temples
- "Other" gods have their own temples as well, which are more previlent and better funded than even the main god temples in the wealthier burgs. They are not oppulant on the outside
- Wizard Towers. Wizards in the town are not really apt to share and be welcoming. There are a few wizard towers in the city, but none in the main burg
  - In the main burg, wizards practice and study their arts in underground shelters, in back alley apartments
  - In the more mercantile and manufacturing sections of the surrounding burgs wizards are more likely to populate workshops, smithys, homes, and warehouses. While still secretive and suspicious, they are more willing to provide their services discretely
  - The slums are where wizards are willing to operate in the open because almost no one goes into the slums if they can help it. Rickety old towers from abondoned keeps and castle ramparts serve as the home for many wizards. These structures are supported by magic to both prevent them from collapsing and also maintain the illusion that they will collapse if disturbed
- Trading in the city
  - Most standard items in the phb are available in the shops of the city with a few restrictions
    - Arms and Armour are strictly regulated by the city guard and militia. As such, most stores won't buy or sell weapons and armor. You have to either trade with an independent smithy or trade with either the guard or the militia
      - There are other ways to buy and sell arms and armour, but you would have to know a guy who knows a guy
      - Magic weapons and armour can only be traded at some smithys, but not typically with the guard or militia
        - There are special shops and smithys with wizard affiliatons which pcs can trade with, as well as underground fencs
    - Magic Items can be found in most shops in the more central part of the city and some surrounding burgs. These items are mainly potions, scrolls, and minor magic items with a limit of 500 or 600 gold pieces. These shops are also in the market of buying magic items with a limit of about 400 gp
      - More expensive magic items can be traded with specialty shops by the warf and in the more affluent burgs.There is, of course, the option of trading with underground fences
- Organizations. There are many power structures in the city, but at the moment I'm only to outline a basic idea or name
    - The cloaked. Zealots, priests, ???. Always cloaked, make long processions through the city, mainly by the warf areas, carry a crude effigy of a moon with a crooked smile, appear shortly after fighting starts in the streets and will try and abscond with the fallen comabatants
    - The city guard
    - Thieves, black markets, assassings, and such
    - Major merchants. A couple sea captains, overland traders
    - Shipping companies. Akin to the East India Trading co, the Black Ball Line (both the NY Quacker owned line and the one operating out of Liverpool)
    - The "Other" clergy
- People of note
    - Suzanne Johansen: Granddaughter of Grettir Johansen, the captain of the tradeship Victoria who deals with people across the ocean. She is a minor noble by way of wealth and influence gained by Grettir. She lives on a small estate in the "Captains' Peer", a place where the wealthier captains retire to and help run the shipping trade
    - Grettir Johansen: Captain of the Victoria who trades with mysterious people across the ocean. Secretive and aloof, he doesn't share his information with anyone, not even Suzanne. Takes on a new crew with every departure from the city. Has personal influence over several differint organizations including some of the "Other" clergy
