# Port City
Ominous, foggy, smarmy
Bay and surrounding slopes formed by a meteor impact. The bay was the where the meteor came to rest pushing up the rock to form a ring around what would become the bay. The approach of the meteor created a long, narrow valley which has since become rather fertile and verdant. The final resting place of the meteor created a deep depression in the earth pushing several rings of rock up and away from the mainland and forming what would become the bay of the Port City. In total there were three prominant rings of rock which, from oceanside to inland ranked tallest peaks with large gaps to small outcroppings connected to the landmass. As the bay filled with water most of the outer ring collapsed into the ocean, while the second and first ring mostly eroded away to become a small archipelego of sharply rising islands which make trouble for ships navigating into the port. A dedicated route outlined by small towers of everburning fire was created to overcome this problem, though the waters are still treacherous and require a guiding boat to help bring the ships to port.
    - More than 20 miles (32 km) offshore, where the outer ring was, the lone sentinal "Bal Eldur" stands more than 7,000 feet (2100+ meters, 1 1/3+ miles) above the ocean waters. This seamount containing curious dwellings which face to the east, away from the land and towards the deep ocean. From its summit a brilliant light of pale white shoots to the heavens strong enough to warn westerly travelling ships, but curiously obscured when looking out east from the city; sunrise and sunset are the most adventageous times of day to view this anomoly from the city. Towards the peak of Bal Eldur is the Geislun Monastary, a temple of training and worship to the gods of light.
An enterprising merchant won favor with the ruler of the area and was awarded the title of duke/baron(?) and given the bay and it's surrounds in order to expand his mercantile efforts and bring great wealth to the ruler. The merchant made his castle on one of the inner ring's outcroppings, connected to the mainland by a golden bridge of dwarven crafstmanship.

### Attributes and Ideas
- City started as a port town, but as it grew it absorbed the surrounding towns until it became a large city. Many of the older towns are now called burgs
- Older towns along the coast slowly decayed into dilapidated fishing slums
- Main docks recieve shipping and fishing boats
- There are two light houses, one on each outcropping of rocks at either side of the bay
- Buildings are generally tall two or three storey structures, some of which jut out over the street and choke out the sun and starlight
- Main town by the docks is the most crowded with lots of sloping streets leading to and from the warf
  - Warehouses, shps, cramped houses, inns, pawn shops, and other such things can be found in this area
- Surrouning burgs range from wealthy to slums
- Temples to the main gods are few, many of which are merely shrines tucked in along the streets. These shrines are tended to by one or a few clerics
  - Full temples to the main gods exist in some of the wealthier burgs. These temples are the stone built, cathedral like structures which come to mind in fantasy rpgs. These temples have more clerics and resources to help those in their burg
  - Some of the slums have what passes for a full temple, though it may merely be a large ramshackle house or a collection of tarps and nets over some driftwood or found blocks. There would not typically be more than a handful of clerics at these temples
- "Other" gods have their own temples as well, which are more previlent and better funded than even the main god temples in the wealthier burgs. They are not oppulant on the outside
- Wizard Towers. Wizards in the town are not really apt to share and be welcoming. There are a few wizard towers in the city, but none in the main burg
  - In the main burg, wizards practice and study their arts in underground shelters, in back alley apartments
  - In the more mercantile and manufacturing sections of the surrounding burgs wizards are more likely to populate workshops, smithys, homes, and warehouses. While still secretive and suspicious, they are more willing to provide their services discretely
  - The slums are where wizards are willing to operate in the open because almost no one goes into the slums if they can help it. Rickety old towers from abondoned keeps and castle ramparts serve as the home for many wizards. These structures are supported by magic to both prevent them from collapsing and also maintain the illusion that they will collapse if disturbed
- Trading in the city
  - Most standard items in the phb are available in the shops of the city with a few restrictions
    - Arms and Armour are strictly regulated by the city guard and militia. As such, most stores won't buy or sell weapons and armor. You have to either trade with an independent smithy or trade with either the guard or the militia
      - There are other ways to buy and sell arms and armour, but you would have to know a guy who knows a guy
      - Magic weapons and armour can only be traded at some smithys, but not typically with the guard or militia
        - There are special shops and smithys with wizard affiliatons which pcs can trade with, as well as underground fencs
    - Magic Items can be found in most shops in the more central part of the city and some surrounding burgs. These items are mainly potions, scrolls, and minor magic items with a limit of 500 or 600 gold pieces. These shops are also in the market of buying magic items with a limit of about 400 gp
      - More expensive magic items can be traded with specialty shops by the warf and in the more affluent burgs.There is, of course, the option of trading with underground fences
- Organizations. There are many power structures in the city, but at the moment I'm only to outline a basic idea or name
    - The cloaked. Zealots, priests, ???. Always cloaked, make long processions through the city, mainly by the warf areas, carry a crude effigy of a moon with a crooked smile, appear shortly after fighting starts in the streets and will try and abscond with the fallen comabatants
    - The city guard
    - Thieves, black markets, assassings, and such
    - Major merchants. A couple sea captains, overland traders
    - Shipping companies. Akin to the East India Trading co, the Black Ball Line (both the NY Quacker owned line and the one operating out of Liverpool)
    - The "Other" clergy
- People of note
    - Suzanne Johansen: Granddaughter of Grettir Johansen, the captain of the tradeship Victoria who deals with people across the ocean. She is a minor noble by way of wealth and influence gained by Grettir. She lives on a small estate in the "Captains' Peer", a place where the wealthier captains retire to and help run the shipping trade
    - Grettir Johansen: Captain of the Victoria who trades with mysterious people across the ocean. Secretive and aloof, he doesn't share his information with anyone, not even Suzanne. Takes on a new crew with every departure from the city. Has personal influence over several differint organizations including some of the "Other" clergy

### Locations
- Geislun Monastary, the Temple of Light.
    - Monks, paladins, clerics, and more train and worship here. Admittance is difficult, requiring the inductees to scale the summit and bathe in the light of Bal Eldur. Those that accomplish this feat are allowed to enter the monastary. Many turn back, some have died, and still others have taken residence in the curious buildings towards the base of the seamount.
    - The monestary is seperate from the Port City, though there is a contingent of monks who travel to the poorer parts of the City to administer aid of various kinds. They generally don't travel into the city unless absolutely necessary.
        - These delegations have no problem leaving and returning to the seamount as their landing is within the seamount and maintained by would be initiates who turned away from their ascent but chose to live within the eastern dwellings.
    - There was at one time a mutual agreement with the Duke to provide services directly to his family in exchange for monetary and political support. Only the upper echelons of the order know if this contract is still honored.
    - It is rumored that some of the more martially trained members have been seen escorting Suzanne Johansen.
    - It is rumored that an enclave of elves lives inside Bal Eldur where the seamount meets the ocean. The curious dwellings are said to be part of an elvish city deep underwater, but abandoned when the meteor destroyed their home.
    - The monks do not know what causes the beacon of Bal Eldur to shine, but its presence gives peace of mind and clarity to those training at the monestary. When implored, the gods do not answer as to who, or what, created the beacon.
    - The Obsidian Ships avoid approaching the seamount and will not sail within 5 miles of is base.
    - There are no piers, and very few landings, for ships to dock. Initiates must take small vessels to Bal Eldur and find a way to safely leave the boats and begin their ascent. Those that choose to turn away from their quest will find their boats again wherever they end up, maintained well and provisioned for their departing journey.
        - It is rumored that those who return to join the monestary will find no safe landing from which to ascend the mountain and will not find their boat again if they turn back a second time.
    - Provisions are brought by elementals from deep within the mountain.
    - It is rumored there is hidden bridge which connects Bal Eldur to the mainland by way of the Dukal Castle
